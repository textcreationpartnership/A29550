         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REASONS humbly offered for the Eſtabliſhment of the National <hi>LAND-BANK.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AS it is matter of Admiration to ſome, ſo doubtleſs it is no ſmall Diverſion to others, to ſee ſeveral of the very ſame Gentlemen, who for ſome Years paſt have ſo ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly oppoſed the Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Companies, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are <hi>Monopolies,</hi> and Infringments on the Rights of the Subject, labouring to ſupport <hi>the greateſt of Monopolies,</hi> viz. <hi>A Monopoly of the Money and Credit of the Kingdom.</hi> For notwithſtanding what hath been urged in a late Pamphlet to the contrary, (intituled, <hi>Mr.</hi> J. A. <hi>his Argument no Argument</hi>) it is moſt certain, if no other Bank be ſet up by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, the Bank of <hi>England</hi> will ſoon be Maſters of both; the whole Series of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement having a Tendency that way, as may appear by many Inſtances too freſh in Memory to be denied.</p>
            <p>And firſt, to get all the Money into their Hands, they iſſued out their Bills with 2 <hi>d. per cent. per diem</hi> Intereſt, which in probability they would have done for an unlimited Sum, but finding their Credit grow to a great height, and that their Caſhiers Notes, which obliged neither the Fund nor themſelves, had obtain'd a mighty Currency, they confin'd their Intereſt-Notes to the Number of twelve thouſand.</p>
            <p>They alſo publiſh'd their Orders to diſcount Bills at 2 <hi>d. per cent. per diem</hi> Intereſt <hi>to all ſuch who kept their Caſh in the Bank;</hi> ſo that all Perſons muſt keep their Caſh with them who expected any Accommodation from them.</p>
            <p>To engroſs the Credit of the Kingdom to themſelves, they refuſed to take all Bills or Notes but what paid a Tribute to them by way of Diſcount, or unleſs they were the Notes of ſuch Perſons who kept their Caſh in their Bank; and where they have bore any Man a particular Grudg, they have rejected his Bills or Securities with ſuch <hi>Innuendoes,</hi> as hath been ſufficient to ſtagger a good Man, and to render his Credit ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>Having briefly obſerved how diſingenuouſly they have dealt with the Merchant, it may not be amiſs to enquire what Treatment Gentlemen have met with.</p>
            <p>To ſecure their Eſtabliſhment, and to keep off the impending Storm which threatned them laſt Seſſions of Parliament, they publiſh'd the following Order in ſeveral <hi>Gazetts,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Court of Directors of the Bank of</hi> England <hi>give notice, That after the firſt day of</hi> January <hi>next (when they have paid into the</hi> Exchequer <hi>the Remainder of the</hi> 1200000 l. <hi>ſubſcribed) they will lend Money on Mortgages, and real Securities, at</hi> 5 <hi>l.</hi> per cent. per annum.</p>
            <p>What will not theſe Men do who will proſtitute their Faith to the whole World to gain their Ends? for it was evident,
<note n="*" place="margin">See the Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on the late Funds.</note> and they were then told ſo in Print that they never intended it. For notwithſtanding ſuch frequent Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations they ſerved the Landed Men all alike without Diſtinction, trifling even with ſuch Gentlemen who were inſtrumental in giving a Being to the Bank it ſelf, and tiring them out with tedious Delays and Attendances, ordering them ſometimes to wait upon the Counſel of the Bank, whoſe private Inſtructions (if one may judg by their Actions) was not ſo much to examine the Writings in order to accommodate them with Money, as to find out the leaſt I law in their Titles, that they might get rid of them as gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teely as they could; and if no reaſonable Exception could be made, they have referr'd them from time to time to their Committee of Mortgages, who as they did not ſit often, ſo they took care not to diſpatch overmuch Buſineſs at their Meetings. Others again, whom they leſs valued, were with a ſhort Anſwer ſent packing out of Town with their Writings, to get Money where they could find it.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the Author of the afore-mentioned Pamphlet would impoſe upon the World in ſaying, that the Bank of <hi>England</hi> have applied all their Money and Credit to the Supply of His Majeſty, and the Encouragement of Trade; and that that Bank would have lent Money to the Landed Men if they had had it to lend: It is certain that nothing is more true than the contrary; for 'tis well known that Bank did not advance their All to his Majeſty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they took in no more than 720000 <hi>l.</hi> of their Subſcription-Money, and that there remained 480000<hi>l.</hi> in the Subſcribers Hands, who paid no Intereſt for the ſame, which (had they had a mind to do) the Directors might have called in at a day's warning, and have ſupplied the Landed Men therewith as in Honour they were obliged to do.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being duly weighed and conſidered, I hope every one will ſee the neceſſity of eſtabliſhing another Bank, and that upon another foot than that of the Bank of <hi>England,</hi> for the following Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is certain, as has been obſerv'd, that the Directors of the Bank of <hi>England</hi> have endeavoured to monopolize the Money and Credit of the Kingdom: and of what dangerous Conſequence it may be, ſhould they effect it, is moſt viſible to any who will but conſider the Conſtitution of the Bank.</p>
            <p>For the Bank conſiſting only of a Fund of Money which is transferrable, and the Votes for the Choice of the Directors attending the Stock, 'tis plain that thoſe who have the Major Part of the Stock, have the Major Part of the Votes, and may make what Directors they pleaſe; who by virtue of ſuch Election will have the Government, and conſequently the Power of the Caſh and Credit of the <hi>Bank</hi> in their Hands. Now if Money will buy the Stock; if the Stock commands the Votes; if the majority of Votes chuſe Directors, and if thoſe Directors have the ſole Diſpoſe of the Money and Credit of the <hi>Bank,</hi> and the Stock being to be bought and ſold every Day upon the <hi>Exchange</hi> by the Common Brokers, the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<pb facs="tcp:41954:2"/>enemies of the Government, even the French King's Emiſſaries, if they will give the current Market-Price, may for leſs than 600000 <hi>l.</hi> be Maſters of the Stock, and conſequently of the Money and Credit of the <hi>Bank.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly;</hi> Before the calling in our Clipt and Counterfeit-Money, the then Money <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

            </p>
            <p>It is humbly propoſed, That a <hi>Bank</hi> may be eſtabliſh'd upon a <hi>Fund</hi> of Land, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> moſt ſafe and certain <hi>Fund,</hi> together with a <hi>Fund</hi> of Money to anſwer all Bills on demand that ſhall be iſſued out on the Security of ſuch Land; which <hi>Bank</hi> may not only be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Majeſty, but will relieve the Landed Men, who are left deſtitute by the <hi>Bank</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prevent the Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Land-Bank,</hi> I am informed the <hi>Bank</hi> of <hi>England</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to take the following Methods.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt;</hi> As one of their Members adviſed them to make a bold Offer, to furniſh the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Two Millions at 5 <hi>l. per Cent. per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, with ſubmiſſion, I take to be a ſtrong Reaſon why another <hi>Bank</hi> ought to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd; for as the fear of the Eſtabliſhment of another <hi>Bank</hi> has been ſome check to their Arbitrary Inclinations, and hath brought them to any Bounds of Reaſon, ſo nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> keep them within ſuch Bounds but the Eſtabliſhment of another <hi>Bank,</hi> which may ſtand in competition with them; beſides it ſeems unreaſonable, That one Society of Men ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs to themſelves the Money and Credit of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>If that fails, I am told they intend to join their Forces with another ſort of Gentlemen, who are for making a <hi>Bank</hi> of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> where Bills are to be given out for 4 Millions Value, payable at Demand, with Intereſt after the Rate of 3<hi>d. per Cent. per diem,</hi> being 4 <hi>l.</hi> 11<hi>s.</hi> 3 <hi>d. per Cent. per Ann.</hi> which if obtain'd, they hope to get the greateſt Part of thoſe Bills into their Hands, and keep them <hi>in Salva Cuſtodia;</hi> by virtue of which Bills they will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled to a proportionable Part of the Incomes of the <hi>Fund</hi> to be ſettled for paiment of the Intereſt of thoſe Bills, and will iſſue out their own Bank-Notes without Intereſt in lieu of them; which Bills lying by them will notwithſtanding, be always as ſo much Ready-Money to anſwer all Demands.</p>
            <p>How fatal and deſtructive ſuch a Bank will be to the Landed-Men, is eaſily demonſtrable; for if a Man can have Bills for 2000 <hi>l.</hi> which he may keep by him, and have 91 <hi>l.</hi> 5 <hi>s. per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> coming in clear: and if the ſaid Bills as the Projectors themſelves in a printed Paper, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>The Mint and Exchequer united,</hi> confeſs, <hi>will paſs current in Paiment as well as Money, and be preferred even before Money;</hi> What Man in his Senſes will not ſell 100 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> Land, which is clog'd with Taxes every Year, and inveſt his Money in theſe Bills? or who will lend or continue his Money on Land-Security?</p>
            <p>Much might be ſaid in anſwer to that Paper, but I have not Leiſure nor Room to inſiſt upon it: The firſt Paragraph ſhows the Tendency of the whole, telling us, That it is reaſonable that the <hi>Exchequer</hi> rather than private Perſons ſhould have the Benefit of the Credit which is needful for carrying on Trade and Commerce. The Projectors would have done well to have given their Reaſons for it; and to ſhew why the Subject, who muſt from time to time ſupply the <hi>Exchequer</hi> with Money out of their Eſtates, ſhould not when they have parted with their Money for ſupply of the Government, have an Advantage by Credit; or in plain Engliſh, why it is not as reaſonable that a Landed-Man, who pays one fifth Part of his Annual Income every Year for Taxes to the Government, ſhould have a Credit upon his Eſtate when he has parted with his Money, as for the <hi>Exchequer</hi> to have his Money and the Credit too. I am ſure thoſe who teach ſuch Doctrine, whatever are their Pretences, are no Friends to His Majeſty's nor the Nation's Intereſt: For certain it is, the Intereſt of His Majeſty and His Subjects are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable; and the more the Subjects are encouraged, the better able they will be to aſſiſt His Majeſty, and to pay their Taxes.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry to ſee that the Landed-Men are in ſuch a dead Sleep, and that when all are looking out ſharp how to get Eſtates, they concern not themſelves how to preſerve their own. A Mariner who ſees a Wrack will endeavour to avoid the Sand; but the Landed-Men ſeem ſecure and unconcerned, notwithſtanding the Wracks and Ruins of ſo many hundreds of them every Year: However, tho they are unmindful of themſelves, I hope their Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives will take care of them, and eſtabliſh a <hi>Land-Bank</hi> this Seſſions in their favour.</p>
